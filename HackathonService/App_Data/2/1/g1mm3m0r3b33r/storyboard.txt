1.

this is a c64 screen.
peek/poke suggest that this is the screenbuffer of the c64.
selecting the page will reveal a hexa string which represents the screen.
rendering the screen will produce a URL (with ascii art)

the url is HTTP://CHALLENGE2018.HUNGARY.EPAM.COM/CONTENT/G1MM3M0R3B33R-

2.

the url is a zip file, conatining the original (but modified) version of Zork
if the players google 'zork playthrough' or similar, they will see how to play the game
their goal is just folow the first steps of the walkthru:

- get into the house
- go to the living room
- get the lamp & sword, then go down the trap door (hidden beneath the rug)
- most guides say to go NORTH, but the Troll is >>EAST<< in this version (the challenge's hint will tell this to the players)
- as soon as they get to the troll they'll see a strange object on the screen that is obviously the solution
- picking up & inspecting the object will revea lthe code 'v='

commandlist:

south
east
open window
enter
west
take lantern
take sword
move rug
open trap door
down
turn on lamp
east
take lcd
describe lcd

the Troll attacks & kills the players randomly
